# This CMake include file defines utility functions for handling generated files
# that are required in another CMake directory other than the one where it was
# generated.
#
# Key functions:
#
# * ADD_FILE_TARGET - Creates a file target.  All source files, whether
#   generated or not should call this function.
# * GET_FILE_TARGET - Given a absolute or local source path, what is the target
#   that will build this file.
# * GET_FILE_LOCATION - Given a absolute or local source path, what is the
#   actual location of the file.
#
# When writing targets that rely on files using these functions, never use a raw
# source path, e.g. ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/example_dir/example.file or
# example.file.  Instead always call GET_FILE_LOCATION on the path.  This is
# because the actual source location may not be in the source tree, but instead
# be in the build tree.
#
# When writing targets that rely on files using these functions, always DEPEND
# on both the file location (from GET_FILE_LOCATION) and the file target (from
# GET_FILE_TARGET).  If you only DEPEND on the file location, the file will not
# be generated the first time through the build.
#
# Utility functions:
#
# * APPEND_FILE_LOCATION - Appends to a list the file location of specified
#   file.
# * APPEND_FILE_DEPENDENCY - Appends to a list both the file location and file
#   target of specified file.
